# PotassiumES

*NOTE* We're just now breaking ground on this project and there's a lot to do. Go look at the [Projects Section](https://github.com/orgs/PotassiumES/projects) to see what's happening and how you can help!

## Project goals

*Goal 1:* Enable the wider web

The "wider web" is an extension of the existing responsive, flat web into augmented and virtual reality. It incorporates the essential harassment management tools required for healthy social systems.

See [What Is The Wider Web](https://github.com/PotassiumES/potassium-es/blob/master/WHAT+IS+THE+WIDER+WEB.md) for more details.

*Goal 2*: Explore new design, art, and social capabilities.

The wider web provides fresh ground to explore new user experience designs, flat graphics, 3D graphics, art forms, and social situations.

This project supports and encourages exploration of these new directions.
