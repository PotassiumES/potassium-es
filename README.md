# PotassiumES: a browser-side framework for the wider web

*NOTE* We're still laying the foundation, so don't use this quite yet

A wider web application responsively supports:
- three display modes: flat, portal, and immersive
- three control types: page, overlay, and spatial
- varied input types: tracked wands, hand gestures, speech

In other words, use PotassiumES to build web applications that are as lovely and accessible on mobile and desktop as they are in AR/VR headsets.

For more information about the supported display modes and control types, see this handy article, [Designing the Wider Web](https://trevor.smith.name/publish/exformation/10080/).
