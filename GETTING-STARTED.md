# Getting started with PotassiumES

** NOTE ** This is mostly a placeholder until this project is further along. Eventually, you'll find a delightful introduction to the main concepts and an easy path to making your first wider web app. Go check out the [projects section](https://github.com/orgs/PotassiumES/projects) to see what is being worked on and maybe even find something that interests you!

PotassiumES is an application framework that runs in web browsers. The ECMAScript libraries that make up PotassiumES are used directly by web developers to create [wider web](https://github.com/PotassiumES/potassium-es/blob/master/WHAT%20IS%20THE%20WIDER%20WEB.md) sites.

## I want to try a sample before diving in

In the [PotassiumES Samples repo](https://github.com/PotassiumES/potassium-samples) you'll find a quick guide for a few sample apps that demonstrate the "out of the box" PotassiumES experience. It takes about 5 minutes and will give you a sense of what's possible.

## The samples were boring, I want to code

Right! The "out of the box" experience is pretty bland, and that's where you come in. All of PotassiumES is designed to be extended by you!

The best way to get a sense of how PotassiumES sites are put together is to dig around in the samples and then change a variable here, a method call there, and get a sense for the common development patterns. If nothing else, go in and change "Hello World" to something else, just to get the hang of making changes.

## The 5 minute setup

TBD: Here's you'll eventually find a handy script for forking a skeleton project and making the magic happen.
